<h2>Objective:</h2>
<h3>Our goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of your daily nutrient intake. This includes Energy, Protein, Carbohydrate, and Fat content of various food items consumed throughout the day.</h3>

<h3>In addition to calculating your total nutrient intake, we also compare your intake against the Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) of Calorie Intake and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) of Proteins. This helps you understand whether your nutrient intake is adequate for your body weight and activity level.</h3>

<h3>To get started, enter what you ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, along with the respective quantities. The calculator will provide a detailed breakdown of your nutrition intake and compare it against the EAR and RDA values.</h3>
