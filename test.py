<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<h3>We aim to provide a detailed analysis of your daily nutrient intake, including Energy, Protein, Carbohydrate, and Fat content of various food items consumed throughout the day.</h3>

<h3>Besides calculating your total nutrient intake, we also compare your intake against the Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) of Calorie Intake and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) of Proteins. This comparison helps you understand whether your nutrient intake is adequate for your body weight and activity level.</h3>
